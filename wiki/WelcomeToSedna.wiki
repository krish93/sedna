= 1. Introduction =

Sedna was developed and tested on Mac OS X and Fedora system, thanks to them first. :)

So, please make sure you are running Linux or Mac OS X on your servers before fellowing these installation steps.

= 2. Install =

== 2.1 Pre-require ==

=== 2.1.1 Memcached Install ===

To run Sedna on your server, you need memcached to be installed first. In Sedna package, we have provided a memcached distribution, which can be automatically stared by our start-up script. However, before run start-up script, you need first compile memcached for your machine. Steps are:

  # cd ${Sedna_home}/memcached
  # ./configure
  # make

Before do these install steps, make sure your machine has installed fellowing programs:
  * gcc
  * make
  * libevent

=== 2.1.2 Jetty Server Install ===

It's quite simple, only need make sure is the web port(default 10010) has not been used.

=== 2.1.3 ZooKeeper Install ===

Install ZooKeeper in distributed mode is necessary for a serious Sedna deployment. If you want run Sedna as a test system on a few servers, a stand alone zookeeper installation is also fine.

After Installing ZooKeeper, please remember the ZooKeeper cluster server list and their port, which we need to configure Sedna before start it up.

== 2.2 System Modify for Linux ==

=== 2.2.1 Hosts ===

We highly recommend users modify /etc/hosts file in servers. As in Sedna we use InetAddress.getHostAddr() to get local machine's IP address and use Jetty to start a local web server. So the best way to avoid not necessary problems is modify /etc/hosts file, and try to find every machine by their name, like nodek.

Remove 127.0.0.1 or :::1's name if their name columns include host name. Add a new line like this:

  * 192.168.1.15 node1

=== 2.2.2 file-max ===

The max number of files a process can open is limited in nearly all the linux distribution. You can check them using:
{{{ 
> ulimit -n
}}}
Usually 1024 in Fedora or 256 in Mac OS X. A large Sedna cluster may need more sockets than these numbers, so we recommend users to modify this value.  The best way is change files in /etc/security/limits.conf, add a row in the last line of that file:
{{{
* - nofile 1000000
}}} 
reboot and that value will begin to affect your system.

It's a little different when you are working on Mac OS X, change file in /etc/launchd.conf, and a row in this file( usually this file is not exist! so you need to create it first)
{{{
limit maxfiles 1000000 1000000
}}}
